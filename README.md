# PYTHON-TRAINING
This repository shows the basic functions of python for training purposes.

To get started, you will need an environment with python installed.  If you don't already have it, you can download it directly from the [python website](https://www.python.org), or from a package manager such as `conda` which is offered with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).  A benefit of using a python package manager is this allows you to create multiple versions of python and it's libraries on the same machine to ensure your scripts function as intended. If you're an ESRI user, you already have conda installed with ArcGIS Pro. Both options will work in these trainings; however, this was created using `conda`.

To clone this repository and all subfolders on your local machine with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), run `git clone https://github.com/bofethe/python-training.git` in Git Bash in the directory you want to clone into.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out.  Good luck!
